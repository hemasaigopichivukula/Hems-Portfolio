Ravi Teja Kakkerla is a Sr. Workforce Manager at Amazon and was my reporting manager for over 3.5 years during my tenure there. He is the embodiment of leadership that empowers rather than controls. He taught me that talent and commitment are enough to get recognized and promoted. His leadership style—marked by humility, openness to feedback, and a trust-first mindset—gave me the freedom to explore, innovate, and grow. Thanks to his mentorship, I was promoted from L2 to L4 in just 15 months.
